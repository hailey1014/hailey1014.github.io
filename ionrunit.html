 <h1> Melo Don't Run It </h1>
 <p> Ball's character is highlighted heavily through the development of this reference. In the bleachers of a basketball game, Jaden Newman asked Ball if he would follow her back on Instagram. Ball infamously repsonds by saying, "ion run it." However, in a later interview, Ball is asked to confirm whether or not he runs his "ig account," and he comfirms he does in fact run it. </p>
