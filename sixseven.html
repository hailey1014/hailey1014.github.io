 <h1> A Confused Math Teacher</h1>
<p> "For the next problem, use this seqeunce from five through ten, so five, six, seven-" The class erupts in disarray. Why? </p>
 <p> If you have ever wondered why the combination of the two very specific numbers -- 6 7 -- has much upheavel, thank Ball. The entirety of this reference stems from Ball's predisposed identity: his height.
 Ball was destined for 6 7, as his corresponding height of 6-foot 7-inches to rapper Skrilla's "Doot Doot (6 7)" alligned in unison to make way for social media editors to use this correlation in editted compilations of Ball's highlights and clips. </p>
